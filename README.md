# FAQ
## Who Am I?
Hi github! I am Itamar Mesa, a System Admin that loves IT. I am located at Seville, Spain (at least for now).

## What is this repo?
This repository will be my "go-to place" for storing all the theory that I am learning summed up from several sources to develop my skills as a Systems Admin/IT person in general. I will also try to include examples from everything for further understanding.

## My story
After graduating in Administration of Networked Computers System at IES Julio Verne (Sevilla) in 03/2021, I was able to join to EUI IT Global Services, which is the technological Spanish subsidiary of Admiral Group PLC.

In this long journey firstly I was able to join in the Engineering Department, I managed to learn the basics and some advanced notions from AWS, and started being part of Infrastructure as Code(IaC) projects based on AWS CloudFormation Windows Servers deployments and then I started working on the infrastructure of a serverless AWS Lambda IaC project that would obtain users and roles from several server's Rest APIs from the company and via Selenium, do comparisons to expected users & roles and return metrics and to do actions based on them.

My experience in the Engineering Department ended as I joined the Access Control team, which is part of the SOC Department, and started controlling users, roles and privileges as a System Administrator. This is what I am doing at the moment!

## What do I have knowledge about?
- Programming: Python, Powershell scripting, Bash
- Data management: csv, yaml, json...
- Databases management: SQL, non relational DBs: DynamoDB
- Cloud: AWS(Cloudformation, Lambda & networking mainly, but learned the basics from the most known services...) & a bit of Oracle Cloud for personal projects!
- LDAP
- git
- Rest APIs management
- Agile methodologies: I am certificated on SAFeÂ® 5 Practitioner by Scaled Agile Inc

## Languages
- English around at C1 level (Got 179 points on a Cambridge exam in 2020, (see [Cambridge Points Scale](https://www.cambridgeenglish.org/images/210434-converting-practice-test-scores-to-cambridge-english-scale-scores.pdf) for reference))
- Native spanish

## What do I want to learn now?
I feel like I could develop myself more in several areas:

### Unit testing & Networking:
- more advanced python (I have never learnt OOP the right way and because I did not really need it for the projects I was working on.)
- more advanced networking (would be worth it for any IT task basically, and nice for SOC!)
- Pytest (maybe could be nice to learn some unit testing, just because why not?)

### IaC:
The first time I understood what AWS CloudFormation was, I got amazed. I love IaC as a concept. 
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Ansible
- Terraform

## Hobbies
- Playing videogames (The Last Of Us, Metro saga are probably my most loved games! (even though I also play League of Legends))
- Hardware (I love customizing my setup, learning about the new hardware on the market and especulating on future hardware)
- Music (Love multiples genres of metal, pop, rap, electronic music...)
