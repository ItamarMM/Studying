# What is this repo?
## Who Am I?
Hi github!
I am Itamar Mesa Mart√≠n, a System Admin focused guy that loves IT. I am located at Seville, Spain (at least for now).

## Repo objective
This repository will be my "go-to place" for storing all the theory that I am learning from several sources to develop my skills as a Systems Admin/IT person in general. I will also try to include examples from everything for further understanding.

## My story
After graduating in Administration of Networked Computers System at IES Julio Verne (Sevilla) in 03/2021, I was able to join to EUI IT Global Services, which is the technological Spanish subsidiary of Admiral Group PLC.

In this long journey firstly I was able to join in the Engineering Department, I managed to learn the basics and some advanced notions from AWS, and started being part of Infrastructure as Code(IaC) projects based on AWS CloudFormation Windows Servers deployments and then I started working on the infrastructure of a serverless AWS Lambda IaC project that would obtain users and roles from several server's Rest APIs from the company and via Selenium, do comparisons to expected users & roles and return metrics and to do actions based on them.

My experience in the Engineering Department ended as I joined the Access Control team, which is part of the SOC Department, and started controlling users, roles and privileges as a System Administrator.

## What have I learned in EUI IT Global Services?
Python, Powershell. Rest APIs & data management (csv, yaml, json...), non relational DBs, AWS(Cloudformation & networking mainly, but learned the basics from most useful services)...

## What do I want to learn now?
I have thought of two completelly different paths:
Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, Terraform.
Pytest network automation, more advanced python and more advanced networking.
