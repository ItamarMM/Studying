## Who Am I?
Hi github! I am Itamar Mesa, a System Admin that loves IT. I am located at Seville, Spain (at least for now). Working in Malaga at the time. I am specialized on Dynatrace, Python & AWS.

## What is this repo?
This repository will be my "go-to place" for storing all the theory that I am learning ony my free time summed up from several sources to develop my skills further as a Systems Admin/IT person in general. 

Of course, most of my knowledge is built on the daily work with companies that partially made me be the person I am nowadays. Anyway, I will also try to include examples from everything for further understanding.

<sup>In this long journey firstly I was able to join in the Engineering Department, I managed to learn the basics and some advanced notions from AWS, and started being part of Infrastructure as Code(IaC) projects based on AWS CloudFormation Windows Servers deployments and then I started working on the infrastructure of a serverless AWS Lambda IaC project that would obtain users and roles from several server's Rest APIs from the company and via Selenium, do comparisons to expected users & roles and return metrics and to do actions based on them.<sub>
