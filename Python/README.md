# Python
In this folder, I will share anything related to Python. A potential basic guide on how to use Python will may be done. But don't expect It too soon, I already know how to use Python so I would better be preparing myself into other topics.

Such as... Programming paradigms.

I had concerns about how Object Oriented Programming worked (with some depth, I already knew the basics on how to use classes). So I created a [Programming Programming Basic Guide](Programming%20Paradigms) after trying to understand some concepts and some opinions of people with more experience in the field than I do. 

Probably, any personal Python projects will also be here.
