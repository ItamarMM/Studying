# Python
In this folder, I will share anything related to Python. A potential [basic guide on how to use Python(Basics)](Basics) will may be done. 

I had concerns about how Object Oriented Programming worked (with some depth, I already knew the basic on how to use classes). So I created a [summary on Object Oriented vs Functional Programming](./OOP%20vs%20Functional%20Programing/) Any possible personal projects will also be here.
